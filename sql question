Here are some SQL interview questions that are commonly asked for backend developers, especially for those with a Java background. These questions cover a range of topics from basic SQL concepts to more advanced topics, like optimization and querying in complex systems.

### 1. *Basic SQL Queries*
   - How do you retrieve unique records from a table?
   - What’s the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?
   - Explain the difference between JOIN types (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN).
   - How would you find the second-highest salary from an Employee table?
   - Write a query to fetch only the first three characters of a string column.
(SELECT – Retrieving Data from a Table
WHERE – Filtering Results
ORDER BY – Sorting Results
INSERT INTO – Inserting Data into a Table
UPDATE – Modifying Existing Data
DELETE – Deleting Data from a Table
JOIN – Combining Data from Multiple Tables
GROUP BY – Grouping Data
HAVING – Filtering Groups
DISTINCT – Removing Duplicate Values
LIMIT – Limiting the Number of Results
ALTER TABLE – Modifying Table Structure
CREATE TABLE – Creating a New Table
DROP TABLE – Deleting a Table
)

### 2. *Data Modeling and Relationships*
   - How do you define a many-to-many relationship in SQL? Explain with an example.
   - How would you structure a table to store hierarchical data, such as organizational structure?
   - What are foreign keys and primary keys? Why are they important?

### 3. *Subqueries and Nested Queries*
   - What is a subquery, and where can it be used?
   - What’s the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries?
   - Explain how you would write a query to find all employees who have the same salary as another employee.

### 4. *Aggregate Functions and Grouping*
   - Explain the purpose of aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
   - How do you calculate the average salary of employees per department?
   - Write a query to get the count of employees in each department, sorted by the count in descending order.

### 5. *Indexes and Optimization*
   - What is an index in SQL, and how does it improve query performance?
   - What are some downsides of using too many indexes?
   - How would you optimize a query that is running slowly?
   - Explain the purpose of EXPLAIN in SQL. How do you use it to analyze a query?

### 6. *Transactions and Isolation Levels*
   - Explain what a transaction is and why it’s important.
   - What are the ACID properties in databases?
   - Describe different transaction isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED, READ UNCOMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE).
   - How would you handle deadlocks in SQL?

### 7. *Stored Procedures and Functions*
   - What is the difference between a stored procedure and a function in SQL?
   - When would you use a stored procedure over a simple query?
   - Write a simple stored procedure to update a salary for an employee based on their ID.

### 8. *Views and Materialized Views*
   - What is a view in SQL, and why would you use it?
   - What’s the difference between a view and a materialized view?
   - How do you refresh a materialized view?

### 9. *Advanced Querying*
   - Explain Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and when you would use them.
   - How would you implement paging in SQL, e.g., to fetch rows in chunks?
   - What are window functions, and how do they differ from regular aggregate functions?

### 10. *Java-Specific SQL Questions*
   - How do you handle SQL exceptions in Java? 
   - What is a PreparedStatement, and why is it preferred over a regular Statement?
   - How do you manage database transactions in Java? Explain with an example using JDBC.
   - What is the ResultSet in JDBC, and how do you iterate over it?
   - Explain how you can prevent SQL injection in a Java application.

### 11. *Data Integrity and Constraints*
   - What are constraints in SQL, and name a few types of constraints.
   - How would you enforce data integrity at the database level?
   - Explain the difference between a unique constraint and a primary key.

### 12. *Case Study/Scenario-Based Questions*
   - If you need to perform a bulk insert of millions of rows, how would you approach it to optimize performance?
   - Suppose you need to update a large table but want to minimize downtime. How would you handle this?
   - How would you design a database schema for a product catalog with categories, subcategories, and various attributes?

Let me know if you'd like explanations for any specific concepts or sample queries for these questions!
