2) Set Interface:

public interface Set<E> extends Collection<E>

-> Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. 
-> It is part of the Java Collections Framework and is defined by the java.util.Set interface. 
-> Sets are used to model mathematical set abstraction, and they provide various operations to manipulate sets of data.

Key Characteristics of Set:

-> No Duplicates: A Set cannot contain duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element, the Set will ignore it.

-> Unordered Collection: The order of elements in a Set is not guaranteed (except for some specific implementations like LinkedHashSet).

-> Implements Collection Interface: Set extends the Collection interface, inheriting its methods and adding specific methods to handle sets.


Methods in the Set Interface:

Basic Operations:

boolean add(E e):
Adds the specified element to the set if it is not already present.
Returns true if the set did not already contain the specified element.

boolean remove(Object o):
Removes the specified element from the set if it is present.
Returns true if the set contained the specified element.

boolean contains(Object o):
Returns true if the set contains the specified element.

int size():
Returns the number of elements in the set.

boolean isEmpty():
Returns true if the set contains no elements.

void clear():
Removes all elements from the set.

Bulk Operations:

boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c):
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to the set if they're not already present.
Returns true if the set changed as a result of the call.

boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c):
Removes from the set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection.
Returns true if the set changed as a result of the call.

boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c):
Retains only the elements in the set that are contained in the specified collection.
Returns true if the set changed as a result of the call.

boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c):
Returns true if the set contains all of the elements in the specified collection.

Array Operations:

Object[] toArray():
Returns an array containing all of the elements in the set.

<T> T[] toArray(T[] a):
Returns an array containing all of the elements in the set; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.

Iteration:

Iterator<E> iterator():
Returns an iterator over the elements in the set.

Default Methods (Since Java 8)

Spliterator<E> spliterator():
Creates a Spliterator over the elements in the set.
Used for parallel processing and stream support.

Stream<E> stream():
Returns a sequential Stream with this set as its source.

Stream<E> parallelStream():
Returns a possibly parallel Stream with this set as its source.

Example:

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class SetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a HashSet
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        
        // Checking if the set contains an element
        System.out.println("Set contains Apple: " + set.contains("Apple"));
        
        // Removing an element
        set.remove("Banana");
        
        // Iterating over the elements
        System.out.println("Elements in the set:");
        for (String element : set) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
        
        // Adding all elements from another collection
        Set<String> anotherSet = new HashSet<>();
        anotherSet.add("Date");
        anotherSet.add("Elderberry");
        set.addAll(anotherSet);
        
        // Retaining only elements that are also in another collection
        Set<String> retainSet = new HashSet<>();
        retainSet.add("Apple");
        retainSet.add("Date");
        set.retainAll(retainSet);
        
        // Checking the size of the set
        System.out.println("Size of the set: " + set.size());
        
        // Converting the set to an array
        Object[] array = set.toArray();
        System.out.println("Elements in the array:");
        for (Object obj : array) {
            System.out.println(obj);
        }
        
        // Clearing the set
        set.clear();
        System.out.println("Set is empty: " + set.isEmpty());
    }
}

HashSet:

-> It is used to store a collection of unique elements.

-> It is implemented using a hash table 

-> offers constant-time performance for basic operations like adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element.

Unique Elements: 

-> HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. 

-> If you try to add a duplicate element, the add operation will simply fail without throwing an error.

Null Values: 

-> HashSet allows one null element.

Unordered: 

-> The elements in a HashSet are not ordered. 

-> The order of the elements can change over time, especially after insertions and deletions.

Non-Synchronized: 

-> HashSet is not synchronized, which means it is not thread-safe. 

-> If you need a thread-safe version, you can use Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<E>()).

Performance:

Insertion -> O(1)
Removal -> O(1)
Retrieval -> O(1)

Internal Working:

-> HashSet is backed by a HashMap instance. Here's how it works internally:

-> When you add an element to the HashSet, it uses the hashCode() method of the element to compute a hash value and determines the bucket location to store the element.

-> Each bucket can hold multiple elements in case of hash collisions, which are typically stored in a linked list or a tree structure for better performance.

-> The equals() method is used to check for element equality, ensuring no duplicates are added.

When to Use:

-> Use HashSet when you need a collection of unique elements and do not care about the order of the elements.

-> It is ideal for scenarios where fast lookup, addition, and removal operations are required.

Constructors:

-> HashSet<E> set = new HashSet<>(); (Creates a new, empty set with a default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).) 

-> HashSet<E> set = new HashSet<>(initialCapacity); (Creates a new, empty set with the specified initial capacity and the default load factor.)

-> HashSet<E> set = new HashSet<>(initialCapacity, loadFactor); (Creates a new, empty set with the specified initial capacity and load factor.)

-> HashSet<E> set = new HashSet<>(Collection<? extends E> c); (Creates a new set containing the elements of the specified collection.)

Example: 

import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        
        // Check size
        System.out.println("Size: " + set.size()); // Output: Size: 3
        
        // Check if an element exists
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: true
        
        // Remove an element
        set.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: false
        
        // Iterate over elements
        for (String fruit : set) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
        
        // Clear the set
        set.clear();
        System.out.println("Size after clear: " + set.size()); // Output: Size after clear: 0
    }
}


LinkedHashSet:

-> It extends the HashSet class. 

-> It maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, which defines the iteration order. 

-> This means that elements are returned in the order in which they were inserted (insertion-order iteration).

Unique Elements: 

-> Like HashSet, LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicate elements. Each element must be unique.

Null Values: 

-> LinkedHashSet allows one null element.

Insertion Order: 

-> Maintains the order of elements based on their insertion. 

-> This is the main difference from HashSet, which does not guarantee any order.

Non-Synchronized: 

-> LinkedHashSet is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe. 

-> If you need to make it thread-safe, you can wrap it using Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet<E>()).

Performance:

Insertion -> O(1)
Removal -> O(1)
Retrieval -> O(1)

Internal Working:

-> LinkedHashSet is implemented as a combination of a hash table and a linked list. Here’s how it works:

-> Hash Table: Like HashSet, it uses a hash table to store elements. Each element's hash code is computed to determine its bucket location in the table.

-> Linked List: Additionally, it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration order, which is the order in which elements were inserted.

When to Use:

-> Use LinkedHashSet when you need a collection of unique elements and the order of elements is important.

-> It is ideal for scenarios where you want to maintain the order of elements as they were inserted while still ensuring uniqueness and having fast lookup times


Constructors:

-> LinkedHashSet<E> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();(Creates a new, empty set with default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).)

-> LinkedHashSet<E> set = new LinkedHashSet<>(initialCapacity); (Creates a new, empty set with the specified initial capacity and the default load factor.)

-> LinkedHashSet<E> set = new LinkedHashSet<>(initialCapacity, loadFactor); (Creates a new, empty set with the specified initial capacity and load factor.)

LinkedHashSet<E> set = new LinkedHashSet<>(Collection<? extends E> c); (Creates a new set containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.)

Example:

import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

public class LinkedHashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedHashSet<String> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        
        // Check size
        System.out.println("Size: " + set.size()); // Output: Size: 3
        
        // Check if an element exists
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: true
        
        // Remove an element
        set.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: false
        
        // Iterate over elements
        for (String fruit : set) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
        
        // Clear the set
        set.clear();
        System.out.println("Size after clear: " + set.size()); // Output: Size after clear: 0
    }
}


TreeSet:

-> It implements the NavigableSet interface, which in turn extends the SortedSet interface

-> TreeSet uses a self-balancing binary search tree (specifically a Red-Black tree) to store its elements.

-> This ensures that the elements are sorted in ascending order, according to their natural order or a specified comparator.

Unique Elements:

-> TreeSet does not allow duplicate elements. Each element must be unique.

Sorted Order: 

-> Elements in a TreeSet are sorted in ascending order. 

-> The order can be either the natural ordering of the elements or determined by a Comparator provided at the set's creation.

NavigableSet: 

-> TreeSet provides several methods to navigate the set (e.g., lower(), floor(), ceiling(), higher()).

Non-Synchronized: 

-> TreeSet is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe. 

-> If you need a thread-safe version, you can wrap it using Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet<E>()).

Null Values: 

-> TreeSet does not allow null elements. Attempting to add a null element will result in a NullPointerException.

Peroformance:

Insertion -> O(log(n))
Removal -> O(log(n))
Retrieval -> O(log(n))

Internal Working:

-> TreeSet is backed by a TreeMap, which is a Red-Black tree (a type of self-balancing binary search tree). Here’s how it works:

-> Red-Black Tree: This ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing logarithmic time complexity for the basic operations (add, remove, and contains).

-> Ordering: Elements are stored in a sorted manner. The sorting order can be the natural order of the elements (if they implement the Comparable interface) or determined by a Comparator provided at the time of TreeSet creation.

When to Use:

-> Use TreeSet when you need a collection of unique elements that are maintained in a sorted order.

-> It is ideal for scenarios where you need to perform range operations, such as finding elements within a specific range or navigating through the set based on ordering.

Constructors:

-> TreeSet<E> set = new TreeSet<>(); (Creates a new, empty set that will be sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements.)

-> TreeSet<E> set = new TreeSet<>(Comparator<? super E> comparator); (Creates a new, empty set that will be sorted according to the specified comparator.)

-> TreeSet<E> set = new TreeSet<>(Collection<? extends E> c); (Creates a new set containing the elements of the specified collection, sorted according to the natural ordering of the elements.)

-> TreeSet<E> set = new TreeSet<>(SortedSet<E> s); (Creates a new set containing the elements of the specified sorted set, with the same ordering)

Example:

import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> set = new TreeSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        
        // Check size
        System.out.println("Size: " + set.size()); // Output: Size: 3
        
        // Check if an element exists
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: true
        
        // Remove an element
        set.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("Contains Banana: " + set.contains("Banana")); // Output: Contains Banana: false
        
        // Iterate over elements
        for (String fruit : set) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
        
        // NavigableSet operations
        set.add("Banana");
        System.out.println("Lower than Banana: " + set.lower("Banana")); // Output: Lower than Banana: Apple
        System.out.println("Higher than Banana: " + set.higher("Banana")); // Output: Higher than Banana: Cherry
        
        // Clear the set
        set.clear();
        System.out.println("Size after clear: " + set.size()); // Output: Size after clear: 0
    }
}
